The IssueTracker extension is a simple and powerful bug tracking and issue tracking system developed to make this process easier for your team. It introduces the <issues /> tag to the MediaWiki markup, which can be used to produce an issue and bug tracking system.

Originally developed by Federico Cargnelutti <fedecarg@gmail.com>.

Disclaimer
==========

I make no guarantees that this is even going to work. It's someone elses project that looks abandoned, and I'm fixing it up a bit for them.

After a quick look at the source code, it's not following many if any MediaWiki coding guidelines etc, and I doubt the security of it.

Use this AT YOUR OWN RISK.
